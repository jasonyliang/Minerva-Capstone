# Tutorials

This folder documents some of the tutorials I consulted to get a stronger understanding of the NLP tools available today. I started following these tutorials since the beginning of the ideation of the Capstone project.

The goals of these tutorials are three-fold:
1. Explore the field of NLP to understand what state-of-the-art tools are available and their applications
2. Understand and be able to implement these models
3. Be familiar with packages such as Tensorflow and Pytorch to be able to use them 

The rationale behind presenting these tutorials is to showcase the application of #designthinking and #scienceoflearning that enabled the project to take it's form early on in the process.

\#designthinking was relevant as the learning from the tutorials iteratively from different sources and using different packages allow me to assess the feasibility of building some of the models and refine my capstone idea accordingly. As I implement more and more tutorials, I am able to modify and refine the design of my capstone project to make it more feasible and interesting.

I applied #scienceoflearning principles during the exploration stage of my capstone project, as reflected primarily in this section of the project. Paying attention to and applying specific science of learning principles enable me to effectively process the information in the tutorials and subsequently apply these tools in my own project. *Desirable difficulty* was relevant especially when I first learned about many of the tools used in the project. Instead of going directly to tutorials that are too advanced, I found tutorials that not only present well-documented code but also provide clear descriptions about the technology used and why they were appropriate. Additionally, as I find more and more tutorials and learn from them, I am able to apply *Build on Prior Associations* to enhance my memories of these NLP tools. The tutorials also provided *Appropriate Examples* using relevant datasets to showcase how best to use these tools. These examples allow me to see what the models would look like if I replaced those datasets with one of my own.
