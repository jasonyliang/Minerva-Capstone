       " 'The invention may be variously modified and embodied in different various forms, and thus specific embodiments will be exemplified in the drawings and described in detail hereinbelow.',\n",
       " 'However, the invention is not limited to the specific disclosed forms, and needs to be construed to include all modifications, equivalents, or replacements included in the spirit and technical range of the invention.',\n",
       " 'It will be understood that when an element is referred to as being \"on\" another element, it can be directly on the other element or intervening elements may be present therebetween.',\n",
       " 'In contrast, when an element is referred to as being \"directly on\" another element, there are no intervening elements present.',\n",
       " 'As used herein, when an element is referred to as being \"connected,\" such connection may be a physical, mechanical and/or fluid connection between elements.',\n",
       " 'In describing each drawing, similar reference numerals were used for similar elements.',\n",
       " 'It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms.',\n",
       " 'These terms are only used to distinguish one element from another.',\n",
       " 'For example, a first element could be termed a second element, and, similarly, a second element could be termed a first element, without departing from the scope of example embodiments of the invention.',\n",
       " 'Expressions in singular forms include expressions in plural forms unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.',\n",
       " 'The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting.',\n",
       " 'As used herein, the singular forms \"a,\" \"an,\" and \"the\" are intended to include the plural forms, including \"at least one,\" unless the content clearly indicates otherwise.',\n",
       " '\"At least one\" is not to be construed as limiting \"a\" or \"an.\" \"Or\" means \"and/or.\" As used herein, the term \"and/or\" includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.',\n",
       " 'In this application, terms \"comprise\" or \"have\" are intended to designate features, numbers, steps, operations, elements, parts or combinations thereof described in the specifications of the present disclosure but not to exclude the possibility of the presence or the addition of one or more other features, numbers, steps, operations, elements, parts or combinations thereof.',\n",
       " 'Furthermore, relative terms, such as \"lower\" or \"bottom\" and \"upper\" or \"top,\" may be used herein to describe one element\\'s relationship to another element as illustrated in the Figures.',\n",
       " 'It will be understood that relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in addition to the orientation depicted in the Figures.',\n",
       " 'For example, if the device in one of the figures is turned over, elements described as being on the \"lower\" side of other elements would then be oriented on \"upper\" sides of the other elements.',\n",
       " 'The exemplary term \"lower,\" can therefore, encompasses both an orientation of \"lower\" and \"upper,\" depending on the particular orientation of the figure.',\n",
       " 'Similarly, if the device in one of the figures is turned over, elements described as \"below\" or \"beneath\" other elements would then be oriented \"above\" the other elements.',\n",
       " 'The exemplary terms \"below\" or \"beneath\" can, therefore, encompass both an orientation of above and below.',\n",
       " '\"About\" or \"approximately\" as used herein is inclusive of the stated value and means within an acceptable range of deviation for the particular value as determined by one of ordinary skill in the art, considering the measurement in question and the error associated with measurement of the particular quantity (i.e., the limitations of the measurement system).',\n",
       " 'For example, \"about\" can mean within one or more standard deviations, or within .+-.30%, 20%, 10% or 5% of the stated value.',\n",
       " 'Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this disclosure belongs.',\n",
       " 'It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and the present disclosure, and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.',\n",
       " 'Exemplary embodiments are described herein with reference to cross section illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized embodiments.',\n",
       " 'As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances, are to be expected.',\n",
       " 'Thus, embodiments described herein should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions as illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing.',\n",

       " 'Hereinafter, embodiments of the present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to the drawings.',\n",
       " 'Since an organic light emitting diode (\"OLED\") display transmits incident light entering from outside thereof, contrast ratio may be significantly decreased depending on the luminous intensity of the incident light.',\n",
